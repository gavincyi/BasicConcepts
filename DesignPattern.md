# Design Patterns

[Reference](https://www.slideshare.net/DamianGordon1/python-common-design-patterns)

### Decorator

Wraps an existing class and can alter the functionality of the methods.

### Observer

Monitors a core class and different observers react different to changes in the
core class.

### Template/Strategy

Template: compile-time algorithm selection by subclassing

Strategy: run-time algorithm selection by containment

### [State](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html)

Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The 
object will appear to change its class.

### Adapter

Allow two pre-existing objects to interact with each other, even if their
interfaces are not compatible.

### Facade

Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class 
library.

### [Flyweight](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/flyweight_pattern.htm)

Helps objects that share the same state to use the same memory location.
